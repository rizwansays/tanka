## The Easiest Way to Take Restaurant Orders With WordPress ##

Own your restaurant sales with [Orderable](https://orderable.com/?utm_source=orderable&utm_medium=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme), the WordPress plugin designed to help restaurants take orders online - with no added fees!

Orderable takes care of pretty much everything. So all you have to do is add the items you want to sell, process orders, and deliver them (or offer pickup). It even installs WooCommerce for you.

Orderable is the perfect ordering app alternative because it’s built on the world’s most open platform, WordPress.

## 100% Beginner Friendly ##

Not a tech person? No problem. You don’t have to have any coding skills to use Orderable. You’ll be able to create your online ordering system in minutes using Orderable and WordPress.

Orderable is perfect for:

* Local Restaurants
* Local Cafes
* Local Florists
* Farmers Markets
* Local Hardware Stores
* Local Drug Stores
* ALL LOCAL RETAIL

## Why Orderable Is a Smart Choice ##

**Ordering Apps Are Expensive** - Most online ordering apps either take 30% – 40% of each order or carry a hefty monthly fee of $99 per month and up! With Orderable you can unleash the power of online ordering for free.

**WordPress Options Are Fractured** - Sadly, before Orderable, to add local online ordering to WordPress you would have to purchase and piece tougher 7 – 10 different products that were not made to work together. Combined this would cost $700 – $1,000 per year. Orderable, however, does it as an all-in-one plugin.

**Online Ordering Services Are Closed** - Perhaps the worst part of using other online ordering services is they are based on a closed platform that limits you in every way. Orderable uses WordPress and WooCommerce which means you’re free to customize your website, to suit your business.

## Orderable’s Game-changing (Free) Features ##

The core Orderable plugin is 100% free. With this you can start taking online orders in a matter of minutes. But that’s not all, here are the features that make Orderable the smart choice for your restaurant.

**Zero Fees**
Say goodbye to giving 30% – 40% of each transaction to 3rd-party apps and websites. Say hello to keeping all of your hard-earned revenue.

**Mobile-First Design**
Orderable looks great on any device, so your site and menu are always easy to use no matter which size screen your customer uses to order.

**Easy Ordering**
Give your customers a smooth ordering process with our app-like one-page design.

**Order/Menu Layouts**
Our flexible layouts let you create great-looking menus fast, so you can get your restaurant up in minutes. No coding required!

**Holiday Scheduling**
Easily create one-off or recurring holiday schedules for your business to make sure orders only come in when you’re there.

**Full Checkout Control**
Set your own fees for delivery and include the payment methods you choose to complete the process (because Orderable uses WooCommerce).

**Order Management**
Be instantly notified when new orders come in and easily change the order statuses as you start processing.
